# 🐧 Hey there, I'm Calvyn!
👨🏻‍🎓 Currently a final year student <br> 📚 Studying BSc Computer Science at the University of Pretoria <br> 👨🏻‍💻 Linux enthusiast

## 🔎 About Me
Being passionate about computers since a young age I've always been, and still am, keen to learn new things. I am by heart a very curious person, who likes to delve deeper into the inner workings of processes and systems. I enjoy tinkering, trying new things and spending time with people.

## ⚙️ Experience
I have worked in different group sizes building different programs: 
* Completed a website advertising different [wines](https://github.com/Yi-Rou1234/COS221) 
* Completed a large assignment testing different [design patterns](https://github.com/Donatello-Carboni/COS214Assignment) 
* Currently working on building a [Pinterest clone](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2024/MiniProject1).

I specialize primarily in backend development, working with APIs. However, I enjoy working with all the different parts of a project.
