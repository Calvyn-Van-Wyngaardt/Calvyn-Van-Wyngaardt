# üêß Hey there, I'm Calvyn!
üë®üèª‚Äçüéì Currently a final year student <br> üìö Studying BSc Computer Science at the University of Pretoria <br> üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Linux enthusiast

## üîé About Me
Being passionate about computers since a young age I've always been, and still am, keen to learn new things. I am by heart a very curious person, who likes to delve deeper into the inner workings of processes and systems. I enjoy tinkering, trying new things and spending time with people.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Experience
I have worked in different group sizes collaborating on different projects: 
* A website advertising different [wines](https://github.com/Yi-Rou1234/COS221) 
* A large assignment showcasing the usage of different [design patterns](https://github.com/Donatello-Carboni/COS214Assignment) 
* [Pinterest clone](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2024/MiniProject1).
* Currently working on a [Travel Planning App](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2024/ABC-Travel-Planner).

I specialize primarily in backend development, working with APIs. However, I enjoy working with all the different parts of a project.
